# Telemed-Ultrasound-Tools
Repository of MATLAB codes for interactions with Telemed ultrasound machine

This is a collection of codes that I wrote for interacting with Telemed ultrasond machine (MicrUs Ext) in MATLAB.
Most of them involve controlling the behaviors of Telemed Echo Wave II software from MATLAB.
