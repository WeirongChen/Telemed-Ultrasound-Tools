# Telemed-Ultrasound-Tools
Repository of MATLAB codes for interactions with Telemed ultrasound machine

This is a collection of codes that I wrote for interacting with Telemed ultrasond machine (MicrUs Ext) in MATLAB.
Most of them involve controlling the behaviors of Telemed Echo Wave II software from MATLAB. 
See the comments in individual files.
